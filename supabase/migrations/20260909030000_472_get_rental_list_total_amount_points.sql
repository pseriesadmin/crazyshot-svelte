-- Migration 472: get_rental_list에 orders.total_amount / orders.selected_points 반환 추가
--
-- 배경(2026-09-09, Migration #471 후속): CMS "결제정보" 탭에 "정산내역" 섹션을 신설하며
-- "기본 대여요금"(할인 전 원가, orders.total_amount)과 "포인트 사용"(orders.selected_points)
-- 두 항목을 표시해야 하는데, get_rental_list(Migration #471 버전)는 이 두 컬럼을 아직
-- 반환하지 않는다. 이 마이그레이션은 그 두 컬럼만 추가 반환한다 — 화면 표시는 별도
-- 클라이언트 수정(RentalDetailPanel.svelte).
--
-- ⚠️ RETURNS TABLE의 OUT 파라미터 구성이 바뀌므로(컬럼 2개 추가) CREATE OR REPLACE만으로는
-- 42P13(반환 타입 변경 불가) 에러가 난다 — DROP 후 CREATE 필요(함수 파라미터 시그니처
-- 자체는 무변경이라 호출부 영향 없음).
-- 파라미터(시그니처) 무변경, RETURNS TABLE에 컬럼 2개 추가 + SELECT 목록에
-- o.total_amount / o.selected_points 2줄 추가. 그 외 전부 Migration #471과 동일.
